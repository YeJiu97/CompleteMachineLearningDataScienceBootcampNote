<p>Hey there, first of all, congratulations on making it this far into the course. You're about to take on two end-to-end machine learning projects.</p><p>But as you know, a machine learning project isn't really a project without data.</p><p>Since making these videos, Kaggle has made a few changes to their website and subsequently, how you download data (the data we use in the following projects).</p><p>The good news is, all the code still works.</p><p>However, some students have had trouble downloading the data from Kaggle (not receiving authentication messages, no download links, etc).</p><p>Not to worry you've got a few options.</p><ol><li><p>Follow the following videos as they are and try to download the data from Kaggle (might not work).</p></li><li><p>Download the two datasets directly as zip files: <a href="https://github.com/mrdbourke/zero-to-mastery-ml/raw/master/data/bluebook-for-bulldozers.zip" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bulldozer data (Milestone Project 2)</a> + <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/9kjr0ui9qbodfao/dog-breed-identification.zip?dl=0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dog vision data (Deep Learning Project)</a>. And unzip them to be used throughout the following projects.</p></li><li><p>Check out the <a href="https://dbourke.link/ztmdatadownload" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">example Google Colab notebook to download the data straight into a notebook</a> (easiest).</p></li></ol><p>Options 2 &amp; 3 will definitely work and get you well on your way to working through the upcoming projects.</p><p>As always, let me know if you run into any issues. My handle is @mrdbourke Discord.</p><p>- Daniel</p>
