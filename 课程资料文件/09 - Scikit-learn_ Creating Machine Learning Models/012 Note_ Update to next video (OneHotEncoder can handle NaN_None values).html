<p>Hey there,</p><p>Just a quick update on the next video to keep in mind.</p><p>In a newer version of Scikit-Learn (0.23+), the <code>OneHotEncoder</code> class was upgraded to be able to handle <code>None</code> &amp; <code>NaN</code> values. </p><p>However, since the video was recorded with an older version of Scikit-Learn, this upgrade isn't shown.</p><p><strong>What happens in the video:</strong></p><p>You will see an error at 4:30-4:35 which says <code>ValueError: Input contains NaN</code>.</p><p>This is expected behaviour for older versions of Scikit-Learn&nbsp;(the version the video was made with).</p><p><strong>What might happen with your code:</strong></p><p>If you're running Scikit-Learn 0.23+ (you can check by running <code>print(sklearn.__version__)</code> ) no error will appear.</p><p>See the update in the documentation under "Attributes" here: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html</p><figure><img src="https://img-b.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2021-05-07_02-00-22-c4d080399b43dd4ccd0a763dafc19c1d.png?secure=nTYdodoYM1cdjWKlzZEsfg%3D%3D%2C1638214839"></figure><p><strong>What to do:</strong></p><p>Even though you see no error, <strong>you can keep coding </strong>(continue with the video).</p><p>But because you see no error, you might not be aware the dataset still has missing values.</p><p>That being said, <strong>you can continue with the video</strong> and follow the steps to fill missing values in the dataset.</p><p>---</p><p>Thank you to ChiraagKV for pointing this out on Discord.</p><p><br></p>
