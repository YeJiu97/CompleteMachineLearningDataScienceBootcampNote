<p>The next video is <strong>part of my other course: </strong><a href="https://zerotomastery.io/promotions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms</strong></a><strong> </strong>where I give you a step by step tutorial on how to ace your technical interviews and get a job. However, since a lot of people taking this course encounter this obstacle of saying "I&nbsp;don't have enough experience" when starting out in this career, I have decided to add it as a bonus for this course. I hope you find it useful!<br></p>
