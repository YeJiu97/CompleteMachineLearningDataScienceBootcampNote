<p>These videos are are from my other course,<a href="https://zerotomastery.io/promotions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> <strong>The Complete Web&nbsp;Developer:&nbsp;Zero to Mastery</strong></a>. I have decided to include them on here because it will help you understand some basic topics when it comes to&nbsp;Git and Github. Enjoy!</p>
