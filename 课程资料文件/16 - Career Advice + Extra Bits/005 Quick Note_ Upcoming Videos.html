<p>This next section is part of my course<strong> </strong><a href="https://zerotomastery.io/promotions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>The Complete Junior to Senior Developer Roadmap</strong></a>&nbsp;where I give you a step by step tutorial on how to get out&nbsp;of being a Junior Developer and towards&nbsp;becoming&nbsp;a Senior Developer. I've decided to include two of the videos from that course that are short bits I give at the end of the course with some knowledge I have gained over years of programming that may help you. Enjoy!</p>
